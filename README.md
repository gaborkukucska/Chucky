# Woodchuck Dam Builder 3000 🦫

Welcome to **Woodchuck Dam Builder 3000**, a 3D simulation game where you play as an industrious beaver (or woodchuck) tasked with building the ultimate dam!

## 🌟 Features

- **Procedural Terrain**: Explore a generated world with rivers, trees, and boulders.
- **Physics-Based Movement**: Swim, walk, and float with realistic buoyancy.
- **Building System**: Collect wood and place structures to build your dam.
- **Day/Night Cycle**: Dynamic lighting with sun and moon cycles.
- **Mobile-First Controls**: Optimized touch controls with a virtual joystick.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)
- A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- A mobile device (optional, for touch controls) connected to the same local network.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository** (or download the source code):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gaborkukucska/Chucky.git
    cd Chucky
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Play!**
    - **Local**: Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
    - **Network (Mobile)**: Look for the "Network" URL in the terminal output (e.g., `http://192.168.1.5:5173`). Open this URL on your phone's browser to play with touch controls.
